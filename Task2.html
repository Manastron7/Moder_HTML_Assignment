        <h1>HTML Entities</h1>
    </center>
    <p>HTML entities are codes used to represent characters that have special significance in HTML or are not easily typed on a keyboard. These codes begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). HTML entities are mainly employed to display characters like <, >, &, as well as special characters such as accented letters or symbols in an HTML document. They prevent these characters from being misinterpreted as part of the HTML code and ensure they are displayed correctly in web browsers.</p>
    <h3>Example of commonly used HTML entities</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>' & l t ; '</b> or <b>' & # 60 ; '</b>Represents the less-than symbol '<'</li>
        <li><b>' & copy ; '</b> or <b>' & # 169; '</b> represents the copyright symbol ©.</li>
        <li><b>' & amp ; '</b> or <b>' & # 38 ; '</b> :  Represents the ampersand &.</li>
        <li><b>' & euro ; '</b> or <b>' & # 8364 '</b> ; represents the Euro currency symbol €.</li>
        <li><b>' & reg ; '</b> or <b>' & # 174 ; '</b> represents the registered trademark symbol ®.</li>
    </ol>
