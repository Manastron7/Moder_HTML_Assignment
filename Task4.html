        <li>Use Semantic HTML
            <ul>
                <li>Employ semantic HTML elements (e.g., headings, lists, form controls) to properly structure content. This helps assistive technologies and users understand the document's hierarchy and purpose.</li>

        <li>Provide Alternative Text for Images:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Include descriptive and meaningful alt text for all images to ensure that users with visual impairments can comprehend the content of the images through screen readers.

        <li>Ensure Keyboard Accessibility:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Make sure that all interactive elements, such as forms, buttons, and navigation menus, can be accessed and operated using a keyboard alone. This is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse, including those with mobility impairments.
